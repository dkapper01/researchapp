The researchapp is at its core a data entry web application that can transfer data between multiple users. My colleagues nickname this application the Kappernater after my last name Kapper. 

The problem: 

At my employer, we were using Google Sheets to keep track of executives we were interested in. We found executives by researching respected venture capital or private equity firms with substantial investments in their portfolio companies. Those companies had the executives we were interested in. 

Google Sheets was being used to store and distribute executives information. Someone manually enters in the venture capital or private equity firms name. Someone else entered in the portfolio companies we found from a firm, and someone else puts in the executive form those companies. Finally, the executive's names were sent to freelancer so they can put in our system. This is extremely inefficient and makes each person unnecessarily do double the work.  

The solution:
